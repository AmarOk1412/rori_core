# RORI v4.0.0

![](https://travis-ci.org/AmarOk1412/rori_core.svg?branch=master)

RORI is a modulable open-source chatterbot platform. The first version was written in 2011 (2.0 in September 2012). I rewrote it in Rust in 2017, and I'm currently migrating the whole communication to use [GNU Ring](https://ring.cx).

A complete RORI chain needs 4 things:

![processus](docs/img/process.png?raw=true)

1. An **entry point** is a application which get commands from an user and send it to `rori_server`. For example, a chat where the entry point reads what users says.
2. An **endpoint** is a application which performs actions requested by RORI. For example, it can execute a shell command or write something in a chat.
3. A **module** is a script activated when a condition is fulfilled and send actions for endpoints to RORI.
4. The **rori_server** which get data from entries, call modules, and send data to endpoints.

# Why RORI?

I run a lot of chatterbots on multiple services (IRC, Discord, Websites, my computer). Some bots do the exact same thing but run on a different service. The idea is to avoid to rewrite the core of each chatterbot and use the same base. Now, I just have to write an interface to communicate with this core on each services.

This is some examples of what I will do with **RORI** (as soon as the migration is finished):
+ Ask **RORI** to launch music on the *best* device (on my computer, or stream on a discord server for example).
+ Ask **RORI** to be alarmed at 7:40.
+ Ask **RORI** to send messages to a friend.
+ Ask **RORI** to shutdown a device.
+ Send a picture to **RORI** and ask to store this pict in the *best* folder.
+ Ask **RORI** to send me a notification before a rendez-vous.

## How it works

Please, see [wiki](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori_core/wiki/)

+ [Definitions](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori_core/wiki/Definitions)
+ [API documentation](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori_core/wiki/API)
+ [Authentification system and discovery](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori_core/wiki/Authentification-system-and-discovery)

## Run your instance

For now, there is no documentation to do that. Neither tools. Will come.
(But you still can clone and make a `cargo run`. I can help you). You will need a `config.json` file like:
```
{
  "ring_id":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "api_listener":"0.0.0.0:1412"
}
```
